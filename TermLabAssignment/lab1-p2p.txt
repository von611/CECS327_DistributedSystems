	This project was both difficult to understand but fun to figure out. There are still some issues we were not able to resolve. However, we were able to transfer several types of files across different machines. It took a lot of researching but overall, it was a fun experience on how networking works. 
	Starting was the hardest part for us because we did not really know where to start. So, we decided to use python as our language because it was easy to find resources and to test our program. After, we researched how to implement sockets in python and how to connect to other machines. Then, we researched file transfers using sockets and roughly implemented a program that transfers texts files locally. At this point we had our client and server separated but figured out how to combine the two. 
	Initially we had trouble finding local ips to use in our program. We resolved this issue by finding the ips through the command prompt and typing “ipconfig” or “arp -a,” which listed the local ipv4 of our local device. Unfortunately, we did not implement ip scanning in order to bind them to sockets. Instead, we manually bounded each socket connection to the device the client was on and listed the peer ips. Another issue we encountered was not being able to sync the files across all nodes. Also, we did not get to implement a distributed hash table as our time ran out.
